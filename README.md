The primary objective of this project is to predict prices using machine learning techniques. I have conducted a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset and implemented three different models. The goal is to compare these models and determine the best-performing one for price prediction.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I began by thoroughly exploring the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics. This involved analyzing data distributions, identifying outliers, handling missing values, and visualizing key trends. EDA played a crucial role in informing subsequent modeling decisions and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the data.
# Results
After a rigorous comparison, RandomForestRegressor emerged as the most accurate in predicting prices. The performance metrics, such as After Cross-Validation calculated 200 rmse and then found out the mean and std of these rmse's, indicate its superior capability in capturing the underlying patterns in the dataset. This model is selected as the final choice for price prediction in this project.
